         Alternative Payment Models (APMs) is a pathway designed to incentivize the adoption of payment models that move away from a fee-for-service system. 
         An APM must include an element of upside and downside financial risk as well as involve use of certified electronic health records and meet a threshold of payments or 
         patients. Participants in APMs that meet all of the criteria are exempt from the MIPS and eligible for incentive payments. Examples of APMs include certain accountable 
         care organizations (ACOs), bundled payments models and patient-centered medical homes.
