        The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) is the major healthcare law passed in 2015. It fully repealed the SGR, 
        replacing it with the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and Alternative Payment Models (APMs), and extended key health 
        programs, such as the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). SHM provided detailed input as the legislation was being developed and 
        joined all other medical associations to advocate for the passage of MACRA. Read full text of the legislation <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2/text/pl">here</a>.
