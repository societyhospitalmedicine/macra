      <div class="modal-body">
       The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued proposed regulations around MACRA. 
       SHM is reviewing the proposals and will be providing comments back to CMS. 
       As the rules are finalized later this year, this site will be updated with more information about the programs and what you need to do. 
       For more information about the proposed rule, read CMS&rsquo; <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/Value-Based-Programs/MACRA-MIPS-and-APMs/NPRM-QPP-Fact-Sheet.pdf">Fact Sheet</a>.
