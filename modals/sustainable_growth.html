        The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula was put into place in 1998 as a way to provide predictable control for federal Medicare spending.
        Since 2002, the SGR recommended increasingly larger cuts to physician payments. However, Congress passed multiple short-term patches to prevent 
        cuts and, ultimately, repealed the SGR with the passage of MACRA, averting a 21% cut to physician payments.
