        The Resource Use Category is comprised of cost and efficiency measures, such as the Total Per Capita Costs and Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary measures from 
        the current value-based payment modifier (VBPM). Scoring in this category will be based on performance on cost measures as calculated by CMS. This category will 
        have a weighting of no more than 10% and 15% in 2019 and 2020, with the remaining weight redistributed to the Quality category. CMS will issue rules for MACRA 
        this year and provide more information about how, if at all, this category will differ from the existing value-modifier measures.
