        The Quality Category is expected to look similar to the current Physician Quality Reporting Program (PQRS) wherein providers will be required to report on 
        quality measures. Scoring in this category will be based on performance on those measures providers choose to report. For 2019 and 2020, the weighting of this 
        category will be at least 50% and 45%, respectively, of the total performance score.SHM expects policies for this category to look similar to recent policies for PQRS, but
        anticipates that CMS may make some changes in the upcoming rulemaking.
