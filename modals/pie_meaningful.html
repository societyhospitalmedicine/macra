        The Advancing Care Information category replaces the Meaningful Use program and is centered around the use of certified electronic 
        health record technology. At this point it is unclear how performance in this category will be scored and how the scoring policies will account for hospitalists, 
        who cannot control the EHR technologies in their facilities. CMS is making adjustments to the policies for the Meaningful Use program in the MACRA rulemaking as it morphs into
        Advancing Care Information for the MIPS.
